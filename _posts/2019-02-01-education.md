AMAZING

AMAZING! I love it!

I HUGELY recommend Seedr!!!!

4 stars instead of 5 because:
- video files can have multiple languages. However, the dedicated video player doesn't allow us to switch from a language to another.
- the mobile version of their website isn't that convenient for adding subtitles.

HOWEVER, these are just small things. The rest of the production works just fine. And the speed is incredibly high!!!
